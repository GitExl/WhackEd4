Version 1.3.0
-------------
Added: support for DEHEXTRA thing fields: Gib health, Dropped item, Pickup width, Projectile pass height and Fullbright.
Added: support for DEHEXTRA extra sounds.
Added: Extended Dehacked configuration with the new states, sounds, things and sprites from DEHEXTRA.
Added: Doom Retro thing fields: Blood, Shadow offset, Retro Bits, Name and Plural.
Added: better Linux compatibility. The application starts and is somewhat usable, but a number of UI issues still prevent it from working well.
Added: state preview now uses a state's unused 1 and 2 parameters as offsets if previewing a state from the weapons editor (right-click state label).
Changed: engine table files can now include (base table) files. This leads to smaller filesizes and makes for easier updating. As a result of this, strings in the Doom 1.9 and Ultimate Doom 1.9 tables are now keyed by their index.
Changed: engine table files list only fields used by that engine to reduce their size and improve maintainability. Default entries for things, states, weapons, ammo and sounds are provided for tables that extend existing ones.
Changed: string editing for vanilla patches will allow any number of characters to be entered, but disallow using the new string if it is too long.
Changed: thing editor properties, states, sounds and flags are now tabbed to save on screen real estate. Especially useful if an engine has many thing properties.
Changed: WhackEd4 is now a 64 bit application.
Changed: moved preview availability warning to notification text inside the patch settings window.
Fixed: the state animation preview now displays action names instead of code pointers for non-extended patches.
Fixed: a weapon's FireCGun and FirePlasma actions would only mark the extra muzzle flash state as used if the action was used on the first fire state.
Fixed: loading non-extended patches that try to set a codepointer on a state that originally had none will now display a warning. Thanks to Zodomaniac.
Fixed: saving a yet unsaved patch while exiting caused a crash. Thanks to TheStupidestBeing.
Fixed: BEX strings that do not appear in the engine selected for a patch will now not be visible in the strings editor, but will remain in the saved patch.
Fixed: fixed a wrong next state value in the MBF tables for S_GRENADE (968). Thanks to hawkwind3.
Fixed: crash on startup in some rare cases where no patch was loaded yet. Thanks to Endy McGufin.
Fixed: maximum string length calculation for non-extended patches did not take the terminating NULL character into account. Thanks to Altazimuth.
Fixed: sprite frame selection up\down button did not work correctly.
Fixed: sound priority values can now be in the full signed integer range (though anything above 127 is useless).
Fixed: the MBF TRANSLATION2 flag is now available and will not be removed upon saving. Thanks to j0e.
Fixed: the MBF TRANSLATION1 flag is now recognized, and aliased to TRANSLATION for Boom compatibility. Thanks to hawkwind3.
Fixed: some typos in engine configuration files. Thanks to hawkwind3.
Fixed: Doom Retro TRANSLUCENT flag now shows up correctly in the flag list, alongside Boom's TRANSLUCENT.
Fixed: An MBF flag alias was missing. Thanks to hawkwind3.

Version 1.2.4

Version 1.2.3
-------------
Fixed: no longer allow a state's action to be removed in non-extended patches. Thanks to Mechadon.

Changed: updated to Python 3.7.
Changed: enabled high DPI support.
Changed: reduced size of installed files.

Version 1.2.2
-------------
Fixed: a serious issue with saving thing, weapon and ammo names that could cause no names to be saved and the wrong names loaded when opening a second patch. Thanks to Da Werecat.
Changed: detecting if a thing is a projectile is now done by looking for actions in it's used list of states that set the momentum as a non-fixed point value. Currently Chase and VileChase being used will cause a thing to not be considered a projectile and it's speed property to be automatically cast to a non-fixed point value internally and in written patches.

Version 1.2.1
-------------
Added: support the RandomJump action in state previews.
Added: Extended DehackEd configuration with the extra things and empty states from Doom Retro. Crispy Doom also supports these.

Added: an option to clear out a thing's properties from a thing's context menu.
Added: DOOM Retro "Gib health" thing property.
Added: barebones patch merging feature by loading a patch 'over' the current one.
Fixed: state and thing copy and paste operations were much slower than they should to be.
Changed: sprite selection dialog now shows sprites at 2x scale.
Changed: always display a state's "unused" parameters since these actually affect a weapon sprite's offset even in vanilla Doom.
Changed: updated to PyAudio 0.2.11.
Changed: monospace font is now the more modern DejaVu Sans Mono.

Version 1.1.2
-------------
Fixed: Doom Retro's PlaySound action was missing a parameter name, causing a crash when it was selected. Thanks to VGA.
Fixed: rewrote sprite name, frame and rotation handling to better emulate Doom's behaviour. As a result, zero-rotation sprites can now replace sprites with multiple rotations. Thanks to VGA.
Fixed: when selecting a new sprite for a state, all selected state's frames were set to 0 when no specific frame was selected. Thanks to VGA.

Fixed: added the second Chaingun muzzle flash state to the chaingun state filter.
Fixed: unused thing flag mnemonics being displayed and saved for the MBF engine configuration.

Changed: renamed the Deselect and Select weapon states to Lower and Raise states respectively, to better reflect what they are supposed to do.
Changed: characters can now be selected inside input fields without selecting the entire field.
Changed: updated to wxWidgets 3.0.2.
