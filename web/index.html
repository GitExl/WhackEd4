					WhackEd4 is designed as a replacement for the old Dehacked DOS utility. It can read and modify any Doom Dehacked patches for versions 1.9 and up, and expands on
					Dehacked's feature list with the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A configurable workspace with separate editor windows.</li>
					<li>Sprite previews from a loaded IWAD and PWADs.</li>
					<li>Full support for Boom's extensions such as codepointer and thing flag mnemonics.</li>
					<li>State animation preview with sound playback (where possible).</li>
					<li>Editing multiple states at the same time.</li>
					<li>Filtering the displayed list of states by thing states, weapon states or unused states.</li>
					<li>Does not require a Doom executable, but reads engine data from table files.</li>
					<li>State highlighting based on sprite index.</li>
					<li>Separate undo actions for every editor window.</li>
					<li>Copy and pasting things and states.</li>
					<li>Support for DeHackEd features of Doom 1.9, The Ultimate Doom 1.9, Boom, Marine's Best Friend, Doom Retro and ZDaemon.</li>
				</ul>

			<h1 id="section-changelog">Changelog</h1>
      <h2>Version 1.2.4</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed: invalid sprite names no longer cause a crash when loading\creating a patch, but are ignored instead.</li>
        <li>Fixed: changing miscellaneous values would result in a crash. Thanks to antares031, Xyzzy01.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Version 1.2.3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed: no longer allow a state's action to be removed in non-extended patches. Thanks to Mechadon.</li>
        <li>Fixed: Boom configurations now properly refer to the red skullcard pickup string key as REDSKULL instead of REDSKUL. Thanks to EarthQuake.</li>
        <li>Fixed: a crash on startup if the program settings became empty or corrupted somehow. Default settings will now be loaded if this is the case.</li>
        <li>Changed: doubled size of sprite previews in the state editor.</li>
        <li>Changed: updated wxPython to 4.0.6.</li>
        <li>Changed: updated to Python 3.7.</li>
        <li>Changed: enabled high DPI support.</li>
        <li>Changed: reduced size of installed files.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Version 1.2.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed: a serious issue with saving thing, weapon and ammo names that could cause no names to be saved and the wrong names loaded when opening a second patch. Thanks to Da Werecat.</li>
        <li>Changed: detecting if a thing is a projectile is now done by looking for actions in it's used list of states that set the momentum as a non-fixed point value. Currently Chase and VileChase being used will cause a thing to not be considered a projectile and it's speed property to be automatically cast to a non-fixed point value internally and in written patches.</li>
      </ul>

			<h2>Version 1.2.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Added: support the RandomJump action in state previews.</li>
        <li>Added: Extended DehackEd configuration with the extra things and empty states from Doom Retro. Crispy Doom also supports these.</li>
        <li>Added: state actions that spawn things (like missiles from monster attacks) will now play that thing's sound during a preview.</li>
        <li>Fixed: unused state parameter descriptions would not be updated when an action using them was selected.</li>
        <li>Fixed: added missing things to the Doom Retro configuration. Thanks to VGA.</li>
        <li>Changed: WAD reloading is now faster and doesn't reset the UI state.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Version 1.2.0</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Added: state animation preview (with sounds) by pressing ~ on a state or using the new state context menu. Pressing ~ again inside the animation preview will restart it. Right-clicking a thing or weapon state from their respective dialogs will preview it directly.</li>
				<li>Added: linking states together can now be done by selecting them, right-clicking and selecting a link option (or use the respective shortcut key). Linking is done in the order of selection.</li>
				<li>Added: an option to clear out all selected states from the state context menu.</li>
				<li>Added: an option to clear out a thing's properties from a thing's context menu.</li>
				<li>Added: DOOM Retro "Gib health" thing property.</li>
				<li>Added: barebones patch merging feature by loading a patch 'over' the current one.</li>
				<li>Fixed: state and thing copy and paste operations were much slower than they should to be.</li>
				<li>Changed: sprite selection dialog now shows sprites at 2x scale.</li>
				<li>Changed: always display a state's "unused" parameters since these actually affect a weapon sprite's offset even in vanilla Doom.</li>
				<li>Changed: updated to PyAudio 0.2.11.</li>
				<li>Changed: monospace font is now the more modern DejaVu Sans Mono.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Version 1.1.2</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed: Doom Retro's PlaySound action was missing a parameter name, causing a crash when it was selected. Thanks to AnotherLife.</li>
				<li>Fixed: rewrote sprite name, frame and rotation handling to better emulate Doom's behaviour. As a result, zero-rotation sprites can now replace sprites with multiple rotations. Thanks to VGA, AnotherLife.</li>
				<li>Fixed: when selecting a new sprite for a state, all selected state's frames were set to 0 when no specific frame was selected. Thanks to VGA.</li>
			</ul>
